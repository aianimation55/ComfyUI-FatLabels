# FatLabels
This is my first foray into making any sort of custom node for Comfy UI. As well as my first time putting anything on Github.

It's a super simple custom node for Comfy UI, to generate text, with a font size option. 

Useful for bigger labelling of nodes, helpful for wider screen captures or tutorials. Plus you can of course use the text within your generations.
